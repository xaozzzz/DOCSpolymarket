​

  * Reduced maximum values for query parameters on Data-API /trades and /activity:
    * `limit`: 500
    * `offset`: 1,000



​

August 21, 2025

Batch Orders Increase

  * The batch orders limit has been increased from from 5 -> 15\. Read more about the batch orders functionality [here](/developers/CLOB/orders/create-order-batch).



​

July 23, 2025

Get Book(s) update

  * We’re adding new fields to the `get-book` and `get-books` CLOB endpoints to include key market metadata that previously required separate queries.
    * `min_order_size`
      * type: string
      * description: Minimum allowed order size.
    * `neg_risk`
      * type: boolean
      * description: Boolean indicating whether the market is neg_risk.
    * `tick_size`
      * type: string
      * description: Minimum allowed order size.



​

June 3, 2025

New Batch Orders Endpoint

  * We’re excited to roll out a highly requested feature: **order batching**. With this new endpoint, users can now submit up to five trades in a single request. To help you get started, we’ve included sample code demonstrating how to use it. Please see [Place Multiple Orders (Batching)](/developers/CLOB/orders/create-order-batch) for more details.



​

June 3, 2025

Change to /data/trades

  * We’re adding a new `side` field to the `MakerOrder` portion of the trade object. This field will indicate whether the maker order is a `buy` or `sell`, helping to clarify trade events where the maker side was previously ambiguous. For more details, refer to the MakerOrder object on the [Get Trades](/developers/CLOB/trades/trades) page.



​

May 28, 2025

Websocket Changes

  * The 100 token subscription limit has been removed for the Markets channel. You can now subscribe to as many token IDs as needed for your use case.
  * New Subscribe Field `initial_dump`
    * Optional field to indicate whether you want to receive the initial order book state when subscribing to a token or list of tokens.
    * `default: true`



​

May 28, 2025

New FAK Order Type

We’re excited to introduce a new order type soon to be available to all users: Fill and Kill (FAK). FAK orders behave similarly to the well-known Fill or Kil(FOK) orders, but with a key difference:

  * FAK will fill as many shares as possible immediately at your specified price, and any remaining unfilled portion will be canceled.
  * Unlike FOK, which requires the entire order to fill instantly or be canceled, FAK is more flexible and aims to capture partial fills if possible.



​

May 15, 2025
