Gamma Structure

# Gamma Structure

Gamma provides some organizational models. These include events, and markets. The most fundamental element is always markets and the other models simply provide additional organization.

# 

​

Detail

  1. **Market**
     1. Contains data related to a market that is traded on. Maps onto a pair of clob token ids, a market address, a question id and a condition id
  2. **Event**
     1. Contains a set of markets
     2. Variants:
        1. Event with 1 market (i.e., resulting in an SMP)
        2. Event with 2 or more markets (i.e., resulting in an GMP)



# 

​

Example

  * **[Event]** Where will Barron Trump attend College?
    * **[Market]** Will Barron attend Georgetown?
    * **[Market]** Will Barron attend NYU?
    * **[Market]** Will Barron attend UPenn?
    * **[Market]** Will Barron attend Harvard?
    * **[Market]** Will Barron attend another college?
