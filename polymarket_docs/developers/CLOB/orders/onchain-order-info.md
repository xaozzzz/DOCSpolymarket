​

How do I interpret the OrderFilled onchain event?

Given an OrderFilled event:

  * `orderHash`: a unique hash for the Order being filled
  * `maker`: the user generating the order and the source of funds for the order
  * `taker`: the user filling the order OR the Exchange contract if the order fills multiple limit orders
  * `makerAssetId`: id of the asset that is given out. If 0, indicates that the Order is a BUY, giving USDC in exchange for Outcome tokens. Else, indicates that the Order is a SELL, giving Outcome tokens in exchange for USDC.
  * `takerAssetId`: id of the asset that is received. If 0, indicates that the Order is a SELL, receiving USDC in exchange for Outcome tokens. Else, indicates that the Order is a BUY, receiving Outcome tokens in exchange for USDC.
  * `makerAmountFilled`: the amount of the asset that is given out.
  * `takerAmountFilled`: the amount of the asset that is received.
  * `fee`: the fees paid by the order maker
