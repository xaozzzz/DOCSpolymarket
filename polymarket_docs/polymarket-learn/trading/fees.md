# Trading Fees

Polymarket does not charge fees on most markets. However, **15-minute crypto markets** have taker fees enabled to fund the [Maker Rebates Program](/polymarket-learn/trading/maker-rebates-program).

## 

​

Fee-Free Markets

The vast majority of Polymarket markets have **no trading fees** :

  * No fees to deposit or withdraw USDC (though intermediaries like Coinbase or MoonPay may charge their own fees)
  * No fees to trade shares



## 

​

Markets With Fees

**15-minute crypto markets** charge a small taker fee on each trade. These fees are collected and redistributed daily to market makers as rebates, incentivizing deeper liquidity and tighter spreads. ## [Maker Rebates ProgramLearn how taker fees fund daily USDC rebates for liquidity providers](/polymarket-learn/trading/maker-rebates-program)

## 

​

For API Users

If you trade programmatically on fee-enabled markets, you’ll need to update your client to handle fees correctly. ## [Developer Guide: Fees & RebatesTechnical documentation for handling fees in your trading code](/developers/market-makers/fees-and-rebates)
