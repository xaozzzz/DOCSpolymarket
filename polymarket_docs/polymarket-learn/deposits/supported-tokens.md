# Deposit by Transfering Crypto

Learn what Tokens and Chains are supported for deposit.

## 

​

**How do I use Transfer Crypto?**

The feature was designed to be one of the simplest ways to transfer your tokens into a dApp. ![polymarket.comxd.png](https://mintcdn.com/polymarket-292d1b1b/YUHnSq4JdekVofRY/images/polymarket.comxd.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=YUHnSq4JdekVofRY&q=85&s=b0bfcc917f51f03c422947be7abcc5fc)

  1. **Click on the Deposit button** and **select Transfer Crypto** as a source option
  2. **Select which supported token and chain** your assets are on from the dropdown
     * Depending on your combination, this **may update the deposit address**
     * Only send **supported token-chain combinations**
       * Sending non-supported tokens may cause an irrecoverable loss
  3. **Scan the QR code or copy the deposit address** and paste as the recipient in the withdrawal/transfer page of your exchange/wallet
     * This is where you’ll specify how much crypto you’re transferring
     * You **must send more than the minimum deposit** amount or the funds will not process
     * Always ensure to **double check the pasted address** versus that is shown on the widget to protect against clickjacking attempts
     * You can click on the **collapsible section at the bottom of the widget** for estimated price impact, slippage, delivery time, and our help guide
  4. **Withdraw/transfer the tokens** from your exchange/wallet and wait until they’re reflected on the dApp
     * You will receive notifications on the Fun widget as your withdraw/transfer processes and completes as shown below
