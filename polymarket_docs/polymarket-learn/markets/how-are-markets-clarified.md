Clarifications

In rare cases, circumstances occur that were not foreseen at a market’s creation and it becomes necessary to clarify rules after trading has begun. In these cases Polymarket may issue an “Additional context” update to the rules.

If you believe a clarification is necessary for a market, the best place to request a clarification is in the [Polymarket Discord](https://discord.com/invite/polymarket) **#market-review** channel.

An example clarification in the market on what Trump would say during Hannity Town Hall.
